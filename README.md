![Ionic React Dynamic Theme Switcher](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/367745915/4f6de700-b5db-11eb-99e3-c71b9034f186)

### Included in this Ionic React Template/UI
* Utilising Ionic CSS variables
* API fetch (dummy JSON)
* Examples of how stock components look
* 6 example themes to demonstrate
* Low-code

Note: I haven't overridden all available Ionic CSS variables, just some to demonstrate and some of the core, visually noticeable ones.

### To run

```javascript
npm install
ionic serve
```

Alternatively, you can add the iOS, Android platform and run natively.
